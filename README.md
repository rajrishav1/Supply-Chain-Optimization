# 🚚 Supply Chain Optimization – Velvét Company

This project focuses on optimizing the supply chain of **Velvét Company**, a global leader in cosmetics and personal care, by minimizing transportation costs and improving delivery efficiency.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Velvét Company is preparing for the upcoming Black Friday surge while addressing customer complaints about delivery delays. The project aims to streamline product distribution across three main transportation routes to meet demand efficiently and cost-effectively.

## 🛠 Project Objectives

- Minimize total transportation costs  
- Fulfill demand for all product categories (Cosmetics, Haircare, Skincare)  
- Ensure fair and proportional use of all routes (at least 10% of total demand per route)  
- Reduce transportation costs by at least 20% compared to current operations  
- Optimize route utilization to prevent overloading

## 📊 Data Summary

- **Routes and Capacities**  
  - Route A: 24,250 units  
  - Route B: 20,039 units  
  - Route C: 12,495 units

- **Product Demand**  
  - Cosmetics: 1,343 units  
  - Haircare: 1,480 units  
  - Skincare: 2,099 units

- **Average Transportation Costs**  
  - Route A: $485.48  
  - Route B: $595.66  
  - Route C: $500.47

## ⚙️ Model and Solution

- Developed a **cost minimization model** considering:  
  - Demand satisfaction constraints  
  - Route capacity constraints  
  - Fair distribution across all routes  

## 📈 Results

- Route A handled the majority of the load:
  - 357 tons of cosmetics  
  - 1,480 tons of haircare  
  - 2,099 tons of skincare  

- Routes B and C exclusively transported:
  - 493 tons of cosmetics each  

- **Total transportation cost**: $2,451,241.37

## 💡 Recommendations

- Redistribute haircare and skincare products to Routes B and C to reduce dependency on Route A  
- Optimize underused capacities in Routes B and C for balanced loads and lower costs  
- Improve resilience and cost-effectiveness by refining route allocations

## 🏁 Conclusion

By applying mathematical optimization and data-driven analysis, the project successfully identified cost-saving opportunities and inefficiencies in Velvét Company's supply chain. The optimized solution achieved:
- Fulfillment of 100% product demand  
- Balanced route utilization  
- Significant reduction in overall transportation costs

These insights provide a clear roadmap for enhancing supply chain operations, improving delivery performance, and ensuring better customer satisfaction during peak sales periods.

## This project demonstrates how data analytics and optimization modeling can transform complex supply chain challenges into actionable improvements, creating real business impact.
